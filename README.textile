Mohiva Elixir is a framework/language for building dynamic XML documents. Its main purpose is the build XML Documents which can change its structure at runtime based on external parameters. But is is also possible to build a complete template language like Twig with it.

h2. How does it work

The framework provides the core of the language. The core consists of the following components:

h3. The grammar

All Elixir documents are valid XML documents. The grammar defines the Syntax for expressions and it defines three kind of helpers which can be used to transform a XML document at runtime. These types of helpers are element, attribute and expression helpers. Attribute helpers can be used to affect existing XML elements. Element helpers can be used to create new content or the affect existing content as well. And last but not least, expression helpers can be used inside expression to transform values.

h3. The compiler

The compiler compiles down all Elixir documents into plain old PHP classes. This benefits the runtime of an Elixir Document when it comes to caching. Because only the generated PHP classes will be cached. Furthermore it can make the usage of byte code caches like APC.

h3. The cache layer

The core ships with a simple cache layer. It provides an interface to build different kinds of cache adapters. Some cache adapters for caching documents in APC or in plain txt files are already shipped with the core.

h2. The structure of an Elixir document

The following example shows the structure of a simple Elixir document.

<pre lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<dictionary xmlns:ex="http://elixir.mohiva.com">
    <sentence id="greeting" ex:Locale="en_US">Hello my name is {% user.name %}</sentence>
    <sentence id="greeting" ex:Locale="de_DE">Hallo mein Name ist {% user.name %}</sentence>

    <ex:If expr="{% system.locale == 'de_DE'">

    </ex:If>
    <ex:ElseIf expr="{% system.locale == 'en_US'">

    </ex:ElseIf>
    <ex:Else>

    </ex:Else>
</dictionary>
</pre>

The document is built with the follwing elements.

h3. Namespaces

XML namespaces will be used to declare helpers. The namespace prefix for a helper can be defined as one likes, even the namespace prefix for core helpers. The important thing is the namespace URI. A URI can be a normal URL like in our example or a URN which defines a PHP namespace in the form @urn:com.mohiva.helpers@. As you can see with this design decision it is very easy to extend the language with own helpers.

h2. Installation

You can install the library through "composer":http://getcomposer.org. All you need is to add it as dependency to your composer.json.

<pre lang="js">
{
    "require": {
        "mohiva/elixir": "dev-master"
    }
}
</pre>

h2. Requirements

Mohiva Elixir needs PHP 5.4 to work.
